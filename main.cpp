// main.cpp — NIBBLE. Card entry point, UI, and output routing.
//
// A program card for the Music Thing Modular Workshop System Computer, built on
// Chris Johnson's header-only ComputerCard library.
//
// NIBBLE reads ONE output of the Workshop System's FOUR VOLTAGES module on
// CV In 1, learns which voltage each button combination produces, and turns the
// combinations into notes (KEYS) or drum hits (DRUMS). See levels.h for the
// ghost rule, which is the piece of this card that cannot be guessed from the
// code around it.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// PANEL
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
//   CV In 1      Four Voltages output          (the keyboard itself)
//   CV In 2      transpose, 1V/oct             (KEYS only, when patched)
//   Pulse In 1   KEYS: retrigger  /  DRUMS: external clock, 1 edge per beat
//
//   KEYS                                DRUMS
//   Main   macro: envelope length       Main   DJ filter (LP | bypass | HP)
//   X      filter vs loudness split     X      tempo, 40-240bpm (unless clocked)
//   Y      scale                        Y      kit character
//   Switch UP = glide, MID = step       Switch UP = record, MID = play
//   Switch hold 2s = calibrate          Switch hold 2s = calibrate + clear loop
//
//   CV Out 1     1V/oct pitch                  CV Out 1     1V/oct bassline
//   CV Out 2     1V/oct harmony, a third       CV Out 2     gate on a shift press
//   Audio Out 1  FILTER envelope               Audio Out 1  drum bus
//   Audio Out 2  LOUDNESS envelope             Audio Out 2  drum bus
//   Pulse Out 1  gate on every note            Pulse Out 1  gate on hits + bass
//   Pulse Out 2  (unused)                      Pulse Out 2  click, one per beat
//
// The root of the scale sits at 0V, so an oscillator at its own zero is already
// in tune with the card.
//
// In DRUMS a SINGLE button is a shift, not a sound: only pairs trigger. That is
// what lets you hold one button and tap the others to repeat a hit, which is
// what percussion actually needs. The singles do play four BASS notes on
// CV Out 1 though — a bonus, not the feature, using an output that was spare.
//
// Calibration starts automatically at power-on: the learned levels are RAM-only
// by design, so it is the first thing you would do anyway.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// SINGLE CORE, DELIBERATELY
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// There is no multicore_launch_core1() anywhere in this card, and that is a
// decision rather than an omission. The whole per-sample load — one SVF, a
// handful of decaying drum voices, the envelope and CV stage — is a few hundred
// cycles against a budget of 4000 at 192MHz.
//
// WorkshopBio needed a second core only because TinyUSB's tud_task() measured
// at ~36000 cycles, fourteen times the entire budget. NIBBLE speaks no USB, so
// there is nothing to put over there, and launching a core it does not need
// would add a real boot-order hazard for no benefit. Do not cargo-cult the
// multicore setup across from the sibling cards.
