// looper.h — the four-bar event loop behind DRUMS mode.
//
// This records EVENTS, not audio. That decision buys three things that matter:
//
//   1. OVERDUB IS LOSSLESS. Nothing is re-recorded, so a twentieth pass sounds
//      exactly like the first. An audio looper degrades a little every pass.
//   2. TEMPO IS A PLAYBACK PARAMETER. A position is stored in loop TICKS, not
//      in samples, so turning the tempo knob re-times the pattern instead of
//      pitching it.
//   3. IT FITS. Four bytes per event, 512 events, 2KB total. One second of
//      48kHz audio would be 96KB.
//
// Quantisation is applied at PLAYBACK, never at capture: the raw tick is what
// gets stored. That keeps it non-destructive, so a later version can add swing
// or humanise without having thrown the original timing away.
