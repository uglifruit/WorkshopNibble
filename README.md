# NIBBLE — Melody / Percussion

**Turns the Workshop System's mysterious four buttons into tools to make
melodic lines and lo-fi drum loops.**

*Four buttons. Fifteen voltages. Ten notes.*

A program card for the [Music Thing Modular Workshop System
Computer](https://www.musicthing.co.uk/workshopsystem/) that turns the system's
**Four Voltages** module into a playable instrument.

Four Voltages is billed as a "minimum viable keyboard": four non-latching
buttons, one knob, four outputs from a resistor network. Press combinations and
you get different voltages — but they are arbitrary voltages, they change every
time you touch the knob, and nothing downstream knows what to do with them.

NIBBLE learns them. Patch one Four Voltages output into CV In 1, teach the card
which voltage each combination makes, and the ten combinations become ten notes
of a scale — or a lo-fi drum kit with a looper behind it.

Four buttons is four bits is one nibble. Hence the name.

## Two cards in one

| Boot | How | What |
|------|-----|------|
| **MELODY** (`KEYS`) | normal power-on | A ten-note keyboard: pitch and harmony on 1V/oct, two envelope CVs, a gate. |
| **PERCUSSION** (`DRUMS`) | hold the momentary switch at power-on | Twelve percussion voices played shift-and-tap, a four-bar event looper with lossless overdub, a DJ filter, and a bassline. |

The bracketed names are what the modes are called in the source, so the two are
easy to match up.

### What the LEDs tell you at power-on

The six LEDs are arranged in a 2×3 block, and the top four mirror the Four
Voltages buttons throughout the whole card:

```
0 1        LEDs 0-3 = buttons A B / C D
2 3
4 5
```

For about a second after power-on, the card says which mode it came up in:

| At power-on | Means |
|---|---|
| **Left column** (0, 2, 4), steady | **MELODY** |
| **Right column** (1, 3, 5), steady | **PERCUSSION** |
| Either column, but **blinking** | Booted fine — but the *Computer's own* CV outputs have no factory calibration, so 1V/oct will not track. Not a NIBBLE fault, and worth knowing before you blame the calibration below. |

The splash then clears and **calibration starts on its own**. On the bench it
reads as one movement: light up, go dark, begin asking for buttons.

---

## Playing it: hold one, tap the others

This is the technique the card is built around, and it is worth learning first.

**Hold C. Tap A.** You get a closed hat. Let go of A — silence, no retrigger.
**Tap B.** A snare. Let go — silence again. **Tap A.** Closed hat again.

The held finger is a bank-select; the tapping finger plays. It repeats
indefinitely with no spurious hits, and it works exactly the same in MELODY.

That falls out of how the card solves its central problem. Four Voltages does
**not** return to a rest voltage when you let go — the output sits at the
last-pressed button's level. So releasing AB leaves the CV sitting at A's
voltage, which looks identical to genuinely pressing A. A naive design fires a
spurious note every time you lift a finger.

NIBBLE's rule: when a pair is released onto one of **its own two buttons**, that
one level is ignored. Anything else plays. So `AB → release → A` is silent, but
`AB → release → A → B` plays B, because the ghost was A, not B. And once the
voltage moves anywhere else, the ghost is forgotten — so you can come back to A
and it sounds.

---

## Calibrating

The Four Voltages knob changes every voltage it produces, so the card cannot
guess and does not try to remember. Teach it whenever you move that knob.

### Set it up like this

> Use **output 1** of the Four Voltages section, with its **knob at about
> twelve o'clock**. That gives ten well-spread, reliably separable voltages.

The knob position genuinely matters. It moves all four outputs at once, and
towards either extreme several combinations collapse onto nearly the same
voltage — at which point no amount of software can tell them apart.

### Doing it

**Calibration starts on its own at power-up**, since the learned levels are
never saved and it is the first thing you would do anyway. You can start
another at any time by **holding the momentary switch for 2 seconds**, and
abort with the same hold.

Then, for each of ten steps:

1. The LEDs show which buttons to press. **LEDs 0–3 are laid out exactly like
   the A B / C D buttons**, so the pattern *is* the instruction — no counting.
2. Hold that combination on Four Voltages.
3. **Tap the momentary switch** to capture it.
4. All six LEDs flash: got it. Next step.

The order is designed for your hand, not for the computer: the four singles,
then the pairs as **top row, bottom row, left column, right column, and the two
diagonals**.

| While it runs | |
|---|---|
| All six flash | captured |
| LEDs 4 and 5 flash once | the voltage was still moving — hold steady and tap again |
| LEDs 4 and 5 flash three times | captured, **but** too close to an earlier combination to tell apart |

### How it ends, and what to do about it

| At the end | Means | Do |
|---|---|---|
| All six **ramp up and fade** | Clean calibration | Play |
| Ramp and fade with **LEDs 4 + 5 flashing** over it | Done, but two combinations are too close to separate | Nudge the Four Voltages knob, hold the switch 2 s, run it again |
| **Two columns alternating fast**, ~1.5 s | **FAILED** — nothing usable arrived | See below |
| All six **flash twice** | You aborted it | Previous calibration kept |

**If it fails**, the ten captures spanned less than about 1.2 V — which in
practice means nothing is patched into **CV In 1**, or the cable is dead. The
card keeps whatever calibration it had rather than installing a useless one, so
nothing is lost by a failed attempt.

**If two combinations collide**, move the Four Voltages knob a little and run it
again. If one output stays stubborn, **try one of the other three** — they
respond differently to the same buttons, and it costs nothing but moving a
cable.

Until you have calibrated, the card runs an evenly-spaced guess so it still does
something. In MELODY, **LED 5 solid** means it is running a real calibration;
**off** means it is still guessing.

Learning is **not saved across power cycles**, deliberately. A stored
calibration would be a *wrong* calibration the moment the knob moved, and a card
that looks calibrated but plays the wrong notes is worse than one that admits it
knows nothing.

---

## MELODY

*Called `KEYS` in the source.* Boots by default.

The ten combinations play ten **degrees** of the selected scale — not ten
pitches. Combination → degree is fixed forever, so re-learning after moving the
knob gives you the same notes back. The four bare buttons are the bottom four
degrees; adding a second finger climbs.

### Panel

| Control | Does |
|---------|------|
| **Main** | Macro: how long the note lasts |
| **X** | How that length is split between filter and loudness |
| **Y** | Scale — twelve of them, ordered dark → bright (LEDs show a bar while you turn) |
| **Switch UP** | Fast glide between notes |
| **Switch MID** | Stepped pitch |
| **Switch tap** | Retrigger the current note |

### In / out

| Jack | |
|------|--|
| CV In 1 | Four Voltages output — the keyboard |
| CV In 2 | Transpose, 1V/oct, ±2 octaves (only when patched) |
| Pulse In 1 | Retrigger |
| CV Out 1 | **1V/oct pitch**, calibrated |
| CV Out 2 | **1V/oct harmony** — a third above, in the current scale |
| Audio Out 1 | FILTER envelope |
| Audio Out 2 | LOUDNESS envelope |
| Pulse Out 1 | Gate on every note |
| Pulse Out 2 | (unused in MELODY) |

**The two audio outputs carry different envelopes** — that asymmetry is the
point, and it is what Knob X balances. They are for driving an external filter
and VCA: patch them at the Humpback filters and an amplifier and one macro knob
shapes the whole voice.
They run from about **25 ms to over five seconds**, so the macro covers clicks
through to long swells. Note the audio outputs are DC-coupled and carry CV
happily, but they are **not** calibrated the way the CV outputs are: fine for
modulation, not accurate enough for pitch.

The X knob morphs between three relationships: **DARK** (the filter closes well
before the note fades — plucks and muted things), **BALANCED** (both together),
and **BRIGHT** (the filter outlasts the amplitude, so the note blooms rather
than shutting down — pads and swells).

**CV Out 2 is a second voice**, not a modulation source: the same note a third
higher, picked from whichever scale the Y knob is on, so it is major or minor
according to where you are in the scale. Patch it to a second oscillator with
Pulse Out 1 as a shared gate and the ten buttons play two-part harmony.

### The scales

Twelve, on the Y knob, ordered **dark → bright** from fully anticlockwise to
fully clockwise — so the knob reads as a single mood axis rather than a list,
and the LED bar (more light = brighter) matches it.

| Y | Scale | Semitones | Top of the ten |
|---|-------|-----------|----------------|
| 1 | Phrygian | 0 1 3 5 7 8 10 | +15 (1¼ oct) |
| 2 | Hirajoshi | 0 2 3 7 8 | +20 (1⅔ oct) |
| 3 | Harmonic Minor | 0 2 3 5 7 8 11 | +15 (1¼ oct) |
| 4 | Natural Minor | 0 2 3 5 7 8 10 | +15 (1¼ oct) |
| 5 | Minor Pentatonic | 0 3 5 7 10 | +22 (1⅚ oct) |
| 6 | m7 Arpeggio | 0 3 7 10 | +27 (2¼ oct) |
| 7 | Dorian | 0 2 3 5 7 9 10 | +15 (1¼ oct) |
| 8 | Major Pentatonic | 0 2 4 7 9 | +21 (1¾ oct) |
| 9 | Ionian (Major) | 0 2 4 5 7 9 11 | +16 (1⅓ oct) |
| 10 | Maj7 Arpeggio | 0 4 7 11 | +28 (2⅓ oct) |
| 11 | Whole Tone | 0 2 4 6 8 10 | +18 (1½ oct) |
| 12 | Chromatic | all twelve | +9 (¾ oct) |

The right-hand column is worth noticing: because the ten combinations are ten
*degrees*, a four-note arpeggio spreads them over more than two octaves while
the chromatic scale packs them into three quarters of one. Choosing a scale
chooses the **range** as well as the flavour, and the difference is obvious the
moment you play it — the arpeggios are the ones to reach for when you want the
buttons to cover real ground.

**The root of the scale is 0 V**, so an oscillator sitting at its own zero is
already in tune with the card — no winding it down an octave to find the
keyboard. **CV In 2** transposes upward from there, up to two octaves.

---

## PERCUSSION

*Called `DRUMS` in the source.* Hold the momentary switch at power-on.

Same calibration, same ghost rule — but the buttons work differently, and this
is the important part:

> **A single button is a SHIFT, not a sound. Only pairs make a noise.**

Hold one button down and tap the others. Hold **C** and tap A, B or D for three
different sounds; hold **D** and tap A, B or C for three more. Keep tapping the
same one and it repeats cleanly, as fast as you like.

That is there because percussion is mostly *repeated hits on the same drum*, and
a keyboard reading of the buttons cannot do it: to play AC twice you have to pass
back through C, and if C were itself a sound then every repeat would be
interrupted by a spurious one. Silent singles make the four buttons into
bank-selects you can hold for as long as you want.

**Twelve** voices, because **A-held-tap-B is not the same as B-held-tap-A**.

Those two close the same switches and produce an identical voltage — press order
simply is not in the signal. What the card *can* see is the level the voltage
came *from*, which is the button that was already down. Latching that recovers
the ordering and doubles the kit for free.

| Hold | tap A | tap B | tap C | tap D |
|------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| **A** | — | cowbell | hi-hat metallic | open hi-hat |
| **B** | crash | — | kick deep | snare snappy |
| **C** | closed hat | snare | — | kick |
| **D** | tom 1 "pew" | syn tom 2 | syn drum 3 | — |

**Hold C** is the workhorse: with a right thumb on C, A / B / D fall under the
fingers as closed hat, snare and kick — a whole beat without moving your hand.
**Hold D** is the tom row for fills. **A** and **B** carry the colour, including
the crash.

### The sounds

All synthesised: a pitched body, a noise component, and an exponential decay on
each. Nothing is sampled, which is why the **Y knob** can reshape the whole kit
at once — every number below is a live variable, not a recording.

| Sound | Pitch | Fall | Length | Level |
|-------|-------|------|--------|-------|
| kick | 62 → 45 Hz | 6 ms | 182 ms | 100% |
| kick deep | 50 → 38 Hz | 12 ms | 331 ms | 78% |
| snare | 190 → 150 Hz | 3 ms | 36 ms | 74% |
| snare snappy | 230 → 180 Hz | 3 ms | 81 ms | 66% |
| closed hat | 6000 Hz | — | 17 ms | 27% |
| hi-hat metallic | 7600 Hz | — | 9 ms | 31% |
| open hi-hat | 7600 Hz | — | 60 ms | 18% |
| crash | 5200 Hz | — | 343 ms | 9% |
| cowbell | 1500 Hz | — | 57 ms | 16% |
| tom 1 "pew" | 420 → 90 Hz | 49 ms | 156 ms | 47% |
| syn tom 2 | 300 → 110 Hz | 49 ms | 149 ms | 43% |
| syn drum 3 | 360 → 120 Hz | 49 ms | 76 ms | 47% |

**Pitch** is where the body starts and, where it sweeps, where it lands.
**Fall** is how long that sweep takes — the exponential drop that makes the toms
read as Simmons-style rather than as short bass notes. **Length** is how long
the voice stays audible. **Level** is its weight in the mix, and the numbers
look lopsided for a reason: they are set by **perceived** loudness, not by
amplitude.

Two effects drive them. The ear is roughly 24 dB more sensitive at 1 kHz than at
55 Hz, so a bright voice needs far less level than a kick to sit alongside it —
which is why the cowbell is 16% and the kick 100%. And the ear integrates over
time, so a long voice needs less again: the crash is the longest thing here and
sits at 9%.

A rough rule if you edit the table in `drums.cpp`: an octave higher wants about
half the level, and twice as long wants about two thirds.

The three cymbal voices — **hi-hat metallic**, **open hi-hat** and **crash** —
are *ring-modulated* against a second oscillator at a deliberately non-integer
ratio, which is what makes them clang rather than hiss. The plain **closed hat**
is not, so the two hats sit differently in a pattern.

**Y** shifts the whole kit together: anticlockwise is lower and longer,
clockwise higher and shorter, roughly half to double pitch and ±3 decay steps.
It applies when a voice is *struck*, so sweeping the knob never warps a sound
that is already ringing — **and its movements are recorded into the loop**,
alongside the filter. Two automation lanes, so a pattern can change its own kit
character as it goes.

Sixteen voices can ring at once, and when they are all busy the card steals the
**quietest** rather than the oldest — so a voice near the end of its decay goes
before one that has just started.

### Panel

| Control | Does |
|---------|------|
| **Main** | DJ filter — low-pass left, bypass at centre, high-pass right — **recorded into the loop** |
| **X** | Tempo, 40–240 BPM — ignored while an external clock is running |
| **Y** | Kit character: lower and longer ↔ higher and shorter — **recorded into the loop** |
| **Switch MID** | Play the loop |
| **Switch UP** | Record / overdub |
| **Switch tap** | Re-strike the **bass note** the held button is playing |
| **Switch held 2s** | Calibrate — **and erase the loop** |

### In / out

| Jack | |
|------|--|
| CV In 1 | Four Voltages output — the buttons |
| CV In 2 | (unused in PERCUSSION) |
| Pulse In 1 | **External clock**, one pulse per beat — overrides the X knob |
| CV Out 1 | **1V/oct bassline**, played by the single buttons |
| CV Out 2 | Gate, 5 V, on each live single press — an envelope for the bass |
| Audio Out 1 | Drum bus, after the DJ filter |
| Audio Out 2 | The same drum bus — either socket gives you the whole kit |
| Pulse Out 1 | Gate on every hit, from the buttons or from the loop |
| Pulse Out 2 | **Click track**, one blip per beat |

The click runs whenever the loop does, so there is something to record along to.
Patch it at a click voice, or just watch LED 4.

**Both audio outputs carry the same mono bus.** They are not a stereo pair and
there is no setting that splits them: patch either socket and you get the whole
kit, which is one less thing to get wrong mid-performance.

### Riding a recorded knob

**Main** and **Y** are both recorded into the loop, and both work the same way
live: **moving the knob mutes that lane's playback** while you move it and for a
quarter-second after. Let go and the recorded sweep picks up again from wherever
it has reached.

Nothing is destroyed by touching a knob — grab the filter, ride it through a
section, let go, and the pattern carries on exactly as recorded. It is a
performance override, not a mode.

While **recording**, a knob writes only where you actually move it. Sweep across
half a bar and that half is replaced; the rest keeps whatever was there. A knob
sitting still records nothing, so it can never flatten an earlier sweep just by
being armed.

Replacement uses a short **window** rather than an exact instant — about an
eighth of a beat — because no two passes over a knob land on precisely the same
moments. Anything within the window counts as "the same place" and gets
replaced, so re-recording a sweep genuinely overwrites the old one instead of
interleaving with it.

### A bassline, for free

The four single buttons make no drum sound, so their CV output was going spare.
They play **four bass notes on CV Out 1** instead — root, a tone below, the
fifth, and the octave — gated on Pulse Out 1 alongside the hits.

| Button | A | B | C | D |
|--------|---|---|---|---|
| Note | root | −2 | +5th | +octave |

**CV Out 2 gates it** — a 5 V blip on each shift press, so the bass voice can
have its own envelope without opening on every drum hit the way Pulse Out 1
does. Live presses only; a recorded pattern has no shift presses in it.

No combos, no scale, no quantiser. Once a pattern is looping, patch CV Out 1 at
an oscillator and put a simple line under it with the same four buttons. It also
falls out of the shift gesture for nothing: holding a button to reach the kit
holds its bass note too, so the root sustains while you play drums over it.

A bonus rather than the feature — but it costs one table and an output nothing
else was using.

### The looper

Four bars. It records **events, not audio**, which is what makes overdub
lossless — the twentieth pass sounds exactly like the first, because nothing is
ever re-recorded. It is also why the tempo knob **re-times** a pattern instead of
pitching it, and why filter-knob moves can be recorded alongside the hits.

The loop stores **which sound** — kick, snare, crash — not which buttons made
it. How a hit was played belongs to the performance, not the pattern, and it
means re-arranging the gesture map can never silently change what an old loop
plays back.

Hits are quantised to 1/16 on playback; filter sweeps deliberately are not.
Punching in with the switch does not reset the loop position.

**Patch a clock into Pulse In 1** and the loop follows it — one pulse per beat.
It **overrides the X knob** for as long as pulses keep arriving, and hands the
tempo back about three seconds after they stop, snapping to wherever the knob is
pointing by then. It locks anywhere from 30 to 240 BPM, and nudges into phase
rather than snapping, so locking on never stutters the pattern.

To **erase**, hold the switch for two seconds to re-enter calibration. That is
the erase gesture: every other control is spoken for while playing, and the four
singles in particular get held for long stretches as shifts, so anything
button-based would fire constantly. Recalibrating is also the one moment a stale
loop is guaranteed to be meaningless — the levels are about to change.

## Under the hood

- Everything is fixed-point integer. No floats anywhere in the audio path.
- Level detection settles for ~12 ms before it believes a voltage, with a
  Schmitt band so two close combinations cannot flicker between each other.
  Triples and the all-four combination are recognised as *not* being any learned
  level, so they do nothing rather than guessing at a neighbour.
- Control logic runs at 3 kHz inside the 48 kHz audio callback; voices,
  envelopes and the filter run at full rate.
- Single core. There is nothing here that needs a second one.
- ~4.6% of flash and ~8.3% of RAM.

## Building

Needs the [Pico SDK](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-sdk) 2.2.0.

```sh
cmake -B build -G Ninja
cmake --build build          # -> build/nibble.uf2
```

Hold BOOTSEL on the Computer, plug in USB, drag the `.uf2` across.

There are Python models of the trickiest logic in `tools/` — the ghost rule and
learn round-trip, the filter's stability, and the looper's event ordering. Run
them after touching the corresponding C++.

## Status

**Working, and played on hardware.** Ten rounds of hardware feedback have
settled the behaviour: calibration, the ghost rule and triggering were right on
first contact, and everything since has been playability — envelope ranges, kit
balance, the looper's overdub, the external clock, and how the knobs hand over
between your hand and a recorded sweep.

`docs/DEVLOG.md` records the design decisions and the bugs found along the way,
several of which were only visible because the trickiest logic is modelled in
Python before it is written in C++.

### The idea is portable

The calibration and keypress decoding here are not specific to a drum machine or
a keyboard. Any card can learn a set of button-combination voltages and act on
them — the ghost rule, the shift-and-tap gesture and the ten-step learn are a
general technique for making Four Voltages playable. Expect siblings.
