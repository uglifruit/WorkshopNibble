// levels.h — turning one Four Voltages output into a stream of note events.
//
// This is the heart of the card, and the one piece of logic that cannot be
// re-derived by reading the rest of the code. It is modelled and tested in
// tools/ghostsim.py, which is a line-by-line port of this file. IF YOU CHANGE
// THIS, CHANGE THAT — or delete it rather than let it drift.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE PROBLEM
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Four Voltages has four non-latching buttons feeding a resistor network. Each
// combination produces a distinct voltage, so in principle a level detector
// gives you a 10-note keyboard for one patch cable.
//
// But the module does NOT return to a rest voltage when you let go: the output
// sits at the last-pressed button's level. Release AB and the CV falls to A's
// voltage — which is exactly what pressing A looks like. A naive detector fires
// a spurious note on every single release.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE GHOST RULE
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// When a PAIR is active and the level then settles on one of that pair's two
// constituent singles, that specific level is a GHOST — the residue of a
// release, not a press. Suppress it: no retrigger, the pair stays sounding.
//
// ANY other recognised level is a genuine press and triggers, including a bare
// single that was part of the pair we just left. So:
//
//     AB -> (release) -> A     ghost, silent
//     AB -> (release) -> A -> B   B TRIGGERS: the ghost is A, not B
//     AB -> (release) -> A -> C -> A   the second A TRIGGERS: leaving cleared it
//
// Only ever ONE level is suppressed at a time, and it is cleared the instant
// the CV moves anywhere else. That is what keeps the rule comprehensible while
// you are playing rather than reading.
//
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY THIS IS GOOD RATHER THAN A WORKAROUND
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Hold C, tap A: you get AC, and the release back to C is silent. Tap B: you
// get BC, silent release. The held finger is a bank-select and the tapping
// finger plays, indefinitely, with no spurious hits. That falls out of the rule
// with no special-casing, and it is the intended way to play DRUMS.
