"""ghostsim.py - a model of NIBBLE's level detector and the GHOST rule.

There is no host C++ compiler on this machine, so this file is how the riskiest
logic on the card gets verified. It is a deliberate line-by-line port of
LevelTracker in ../levels.cpp: same integer arithmetic, same shifts, same
constants. If levels.cpp changes, CHANGE THIS TOO - or delete it rather than
let it drift into telling you a comfortable lie.

Two things are checked here:

  1. THE GHOST RULE. Four Voltages does not return to a rest voltage when you
     let go: the output sits at the last-pressed button's level. So releasing AB
     leaves the CV at A's voltage, indistinguishable from pressing A. The ghost
     rule suppresses exactly that one level, and only until the CV moves
     somewhere else. These tests assert the resulting note stream for real
     playing gestures.

  2. THE LEARN PASS END TO END. Not merely "did it capture ten numbers", but:
     drive a simulated learn, build the threshold table from it, then replay
     every combo through the finished detector and assert each one classifies
     back to itself. That is the property that actually matters, and it is the
     one that catches an off-by-one in the sort or the threshold midpoints.
