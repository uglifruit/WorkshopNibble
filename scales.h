// scales.h — the twelve scales the Y knob selects between.

// Tables taken from 89_Lockstep/src/markov_scales.h (Workshop System release

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHY DEGREE-INDEXED AND NOT NEAREST-NOTE QUANTISING
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// The obvious thing is to treat the Four Voltages reading as a pitch and snap
// it to the nearest scale tone, which is what Lockstep's own QuantizeToScale()
// does. That is wrong here, and it is worth being explicit about why.
//
// The levels are NOT pitches. They are resistor-divider outputs whose spacing
// is a property of the network, not of music, and the Four Voltages knob moves
// all of them unpredictably. Snapping them to nearest notes would mean:
//
//   - the combo -> pitch mapping changes every time the knob is touched, and
//   - several combos collapse onto the same note whenever two levels happen to
//     land inside one semitone of each other.
//
// Indexing by DEGREE instead gives the property an instrument actually needs:
// combo index 0..9 maps to scale degree 0..9, deterministically, forever. Move
// the knob, re-learn, and the same buttons still play the same degrees. The
// voltages decide only WHICH combo you pressed, never which note it is.
//
// Access function shape is from 19_CA_Sequencer/main.cpp:220.
