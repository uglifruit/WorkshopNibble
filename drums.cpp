// The kit
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// Combo order is A B C D AB AC AD BC BD CD. Kick and snare are on A and B so
// the two sounds a pattern is mostly made of need one finger each; the toms sit
// on pairs sharing a finger, so hold-A-and-tap gives a tom run.

/// The kit as a flat list of VOICES, which is what the looper records.
///
/// A recorded event stores "kick", not "C held while D was tapped". That is the
/// right level of abstraction: how a hit was produced is a property of the
/// performance, not of the pattern, and storing the gesture meant a replayed
/// loop had to re-derive a sound from a combination that no longer had a shift
/// attached to it. It also means a future edit to the mapping does not silently
/// change what an existing loop plays.
///
/// Index order is the display order, and matches kVoiceName below.
/// Pitches are written as HzToInc(...) so the table can be READ as frequencies
/// and checked against what a drum should be. The first version of this kit
/// carried raw increments inherited from another card whose accumulator was a
/// different width, and every voice came out about an octave and a half sharp —
/// a "kick" at 2.5kHz — which is invisible in a column of bare integers and
/// obvious the moment the unit is in the source.
