// Everything is synthesised, not sampled. That is a deliberate choice and it
// buys three things: no flash cost, no sample-upload machinery (no USB, no web
// UI, no reserved flash region), and a Y knob that can reshape the whole kit
// simply by scaling parameters that are already live variables. Baked PCM would
// have turned "Y adjusts the sounds" into a resampling problem.
//
// The voice structure is generalised from 74_Wild_Pebble/WildPebble.cpp:787-901
// (Workshop System release 74): a phase accumulator masked to 12 bits, a
// triangle folded out of it, the pitch swept downward while the envelope runs,
// and exponential decay via `e -= (e >> shift) + 1`. Kick and snare there are
// the same code with different shifts; this makes that explicit and adds a
// noise-mix parameter so hats and claps come from the same struct.
